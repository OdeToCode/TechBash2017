            "bio": "I started knitting at age seven because it was safer than embroidery, and landed my first professional gig in 1962, at age 14, when I was commissioned  to knit three angora sweaters for a girl at my school. Thus I grew up with knitting as much a part of my world as eating. It’s what we did. And although my primary profession was teaching high school English, when my son was little and I wanted to work from home it made sense to open a knitting school next door. ",

Viewed from geological time the work is not completed, and looking alone to our Great Lakes, their present boundaries and trend are only transitory.",
